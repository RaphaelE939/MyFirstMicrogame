# MyFirstMicrogame
There was no setup for my game
In the 2D platformer microgame, I learned how to customize and improve my game, like changing the character color, its run speed and its jump speed. The tutorials were fun and easy to follow. What worked well was how I made my game unique by adding more enemies, changing my character size, and adding more tokens. I had a challenge when my enemies randomly disappeared, and when the game view stopped following the character, but in the end, I managed to figured it out. Overall, it was fun experience!
