// The character I made was a chill guy and I created him because I am a chill guy. I made my backround a building with a sun set in the bacground because it's chill. I made the platform street lights because it matches the building's in the bacground.
// I used:
pixelart.com // to make my character, background, and obstacles because I wanted it to be pixelart.
// I exported the assets into Unity by downloading them as .PNG file.
// While trying to make import the assets into Unity, I had a problem at first where the camera symbol wasn't showing, and then my character eith deleted itself or didn't move.
// Eventually, after a lot of trial and error, I got my charater on the screen and made it move.
